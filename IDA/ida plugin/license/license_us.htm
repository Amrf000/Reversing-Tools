      <h1>End User Agreement</h1>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT: This End User Agreement (the “<span class="style1 style2">Agreement</span>”) contains the terms and conditions governing access to and use of all of the Services and Software obtained from AVG (each, a “<span class="style1 style2">Solution</span>”) by you and any entity or individual you represent or for whose computer, smartphone or other Device you acquire the Solutions (“<span class="style1 style2">you</span>”). By clicking the “ACCEPT” or “ACTIVATE” or similar option in connection with this Agreement, you agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions not just with respect to the Solution you are obtaining at the time, but also for any additional Solution you later acquire directly or indirectly through that first Solution, including new and different products or services, or updates and upgrades to a prior Solution, for which you do not accept a separate end user license agreement.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>If you do not wish to agree to these terms, please click “DECLINE” or “CANCEL” or “BACK” or any similar option presented with this Agreement. If you do so, you will not be able to use the Solutions covered by this Agreement. If you decline to accept this Agreement, or if you are not satisfied with a Solution for any other reason, you may obtain a refund of the amounts you have paid for the Solutions within the past 30 days by following the instructions <a href="http://www.avg.com/billing" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>AVG may amend this Agreement at any time by notice provided to you in accordance with this Agreement, and your continued use of, or decision not to seek a refund for, any Solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute your acceptance of the amendment of this Agreement. AVG may require that you accept the amendment of this Agreement in order to continue using Solutions you have previously purchased. If you decline to accept the amendment of this Agreement, AVG may terminate your use of the affected Solutions, in which case we will refund the amounts you paid for the Solutions (prorated for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Term).</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Note that this Agreement comes in two parts. Sections 1 through 11 of this Agreement (the “<span class="style1 style2">General Terms</span>”) apply to all Solutions, including those listed below. Section 13 sets out additional terms and conditions (“<span class="style1 style2">Special Terms</span>”) that apply to specific Solutions, including <span class="style1 style2">AVG Identity Alert</span>, <span class="style1 style2">AVG Do Not Track</span>, <span class="style1 style2">AVG Security and Safeguard Toolbars</span>, <span class="style1 style2">AVG Online Backup Service</span>; <span class="style1 style2">Data Seeding</span>, and <span class="style1 style2">AVG Personal Support, CloudCare and Managed Workplace</span>.

            <ul>
               <li>2.1. <span class="style1">Grant of License</span>. AVG, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, hereby grants you a nonexclusive and non-transferable license to use each Solution you purchase or otherwise properly acquire, in each case during the applicable Subscription Term for Authorized Purposes in accordance with the Applicable Conditions and, if applicable, Technical Specifications. The Subscription Term for Free Solutions continues indefinitely, without the need for extensions, until you or AVG terminates it in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
               <li>
                  2.2. <span class="style1">Limitations</span>.
                  <ul class="nostyle">
                     <li>2.2.1. <span class="style1">General</span>. You will not, and will not permit any third party to, (i) use any license key, username/password combination or other authorization code or number supplied by AVG in connection with any Solution on more than the number of Devices specified by the Applicable Conditions, (ii) disclose any license key, username/password combination or other authorization code or number to any party other than AVG or AVG designated representatives, (iii) except as expressly authorized by law, (A) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, reconstruct, transform or extract any Solution or any portion of the Solution (including without limitation any related malware signatures and malware detection routines), or (B) change, modify or otherwise alter any Solution (including without limitation any related malware signatures and malware detection routines), (iv) publish, resell, distribute, broadcast, transmit, communicate, transfer, pledge, rent, share or sublicense any Solution, (v) grant any third party access to or use of any Solution on a service bureau, timesharing, subscription service or application service provider or other similar basis, (vi) test or benchmark, or disclose or publish testing or benchmark results, for any AVG Solution without AVG’s prior written consent (which you may request at <a href="http://www.avg.com/benchmarking" target="_blank">http://www.avg.com/benchmarking</a>), or (vii) defeat or circumvent, attempt to defeat or circumvent, or authorize or assist any third party in defeating or circumventing controls on the installation or use of copies of any Solution.</li>

                     <li>2.2.2. <span class="style1">Software</span>. In addition to the limitations established by Section 2.2.1, you will not (i) copy Software for any purpose other than, as reasonably necessary to use the same as contemplated by this Agreement, and to preserve 1 uninstalled/off-line copy for disaster recovery purposes; (ii) install the Software on any operating system not supported by AVG as reflected in the Technical Specifications, or (iii) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from the Software.</li>

                     <li>2.2.3. <span class="style1">Administrator Rights</span>. Certain Solutions grant you or another user administrative privileges that, among other things, may allow the administrator to monitor other Devices and/or the status of Solutions deployed on other Devices, including for example subscription status, Solution notifications and messages. You represent and warrant that you will exercise administrator privileges only with respect to Devices and Solutions for which you are authorized and for no other purpose. You also represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept this Agreement on behalf of owners and users of those administered Devices, and hereby accept this Agreement on their behalf.</li>

                     <li>2.2.4. <span class="style1">Warning</span>. IF YOU USE ANY SOLUTION FOR PURPOSES OR IN A MANNER NOT AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE COMMITTING A MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY VIOLATE APPLICABLE COPYRIGHT LAWS, AND ALL WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY AVG FOR THE SOLUTION WILL TERMINATE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING YOUR BREACH.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>2.3. <span class="style1">Third Party Fees</span>. You may incur access fees or data or usage fees from third parties (such as your Internet provider or mobile carrier) in connection with your use of a Solution. For instance, you may incur such fees if you use the Solution and it downloads Updates including malware definitions. You are responsible for all such fees.</li>

               <li>2.4. <span class="style1">Updates</span>. AVG, from time to time during the Subscription Term and, <strong class="style2">without your separate permission or consent</strong>, may deploy Updates for any Solution, and <strong class="style2">you may not be able to use the applicable Solution or Device (or certain functions of the Device) until the Update is fully installed</strong>. Updates will be deemed a part of the Solution for all purposes under this Agreement. <strong class="style2">Updates may include both additions to and removals of particular functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and the content and functionality of such updates is at the sole discretion of AVG</strong>. AVG or your Device may offer you the option to decline or delay Updates, but you must download and permit installation of all available Updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution. <strong class="style2">AVG may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed all Updates</strong>. AVG will determine when and if Updates are appropriate and has no obligation to make any Updates available to you. AVG in its sole discretion may stop providing Updates for any version of the Solution other than the most current version, or Updates supporting use of the Solution in connection with any versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other software with which the Solution is designed to operate.</li>

               <li>2.5. <span class="style1">Conflicting Functionality and Uninstallation</span>. Certain Software, during its installation, may disable existing
                  functionality, such as a firewall, and replace it with functionality provided with the Solution. If you uninstall the
                  Solution, you may be prompted to activate other software. AVG strongly advises you to activate such other
                  software as prompted once the Solution has been uninstalled. Some third-party applications may not allow the
                  Solutions to install or run correctly. If you choose to ignore the warnings provided during the installation of the
                  Solution, such Solutions may not function properly, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
                  AVG disclaims any and all warranties and liability with respect to such Solutions. Additionally, AVG does not
                  support third-party applications which provide uninstallation functionality for our Solutions as they may cause
                  further problems for the end user. Should you choose to use such third-party uninstallers, notwithstanding anything
                  to the contrary in this Agreement, AVG disclaims any and all warranties and liability with respect to such Solutions.
               </li>
               <li>2.6. <span class="style1">User Comments</span>. AVG welcomes your comments concerning Solutions, including notice that you have
                  experienced a failure, error or other malfunction, and suggestions for additional or different features and functions.
                  Please send us your comments and suggestions using the web form located at <a href="http://www.avg.com/feedback-entry" target="_blank">http://www.avg.com/feedback-entry</a>.
                  AVG accepts no obligation to respond or act on any such comments or suggestions and this invitation to comment
                  does not constitute any admission of liability or product failure of a Solution, but you grant AVG a perpetual,
                  irrevocable, transferrable, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under your
                  intellectual property rights (if any) to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense
                  (through multiple levels), modify, display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative
                  works of, and otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever your comments and suggestions in any Solution and
                  other products and services.
               </li>
               <li>2.7. <span class="style1">User Content</span>. Certain Solutions may enable you to publish or share publicly with others content you have
                  generated or obtained from other sources (“<span class="style1 style2">User Content</span>”). You retain any and all intellectual property rights you
                  already hold under applicable law in User Content you publish or share through the Solution, subject to the rights,
                  licenses, and other terms of this Agreement, including any underlying rights of others in any User Content that you
                  may use or modify. You grant to AVG, a non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide,
                  irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, resell,
                  sublicense (through multiple levels), modify, display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate,
                  make derivative works of, and otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of the User Content
                  you publish or share through a Solution (and derivative works thereof), solely for the purpose of providing the
                  Solutions to you under this Agreement. Each time you publish or share any User Content, you represent and warrant
                  that you are at least the age of majority in the state in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have
                  all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User
                  Content you publish or share, and that, in regard to that User Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the
                  intellectual property and other rights to the User Content, or you have a lawful right to publish and share the User
                  Content and grant AVG the right to use it as described in this Section, all without any AVG obligation to obtain
                  consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of AVG; (b) the User Content is accurate;
                  (c) the User Content does not and, as to AVG’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in this Agreement, will not
                  infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d) the User Content will not violate this
                  Agreement or cause injury or harm to any person.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. SUBSCRIPTION EXTENSIONS, TERMINATION.</h3>
            <p>To the extent you purchased your license directly from AVG under a separate written agreement or from an AVG
               business partner you are paying directly for your Solution, this provision and refund terms set forth in this
               Agreement may not apply to you. Please refer to your written agreement for subscription periods, renewals and
               refunds information.
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>3.1. <span class="style1">Subscription Extensions</span>. At the end of any Subscription Term, your subscription may extend for
                  successive terms (each, an “<span class="style1 style2">Extension Term</span>”) in accordance with this Section 3.1. If, under the Applicable
                  Conditions for a given Solution, the Subscription Term automatically extends for an additional month, year or a
                  similar consecutive time period, AVG may provide you with a notice that includes instructions on how to cancel
                  your subscription at the end of the current Subscription Term. You may cancel your subscription at the end of the
                  Subscription Term by following the instructions in the notice. You may also cancel your subscription at any time
                  during the Subscription Term by visiting <a href="https://myaccount.avg.com/my-account-login" target="_blank">https://myaccount.avg.com/my-account-login</a>. Canceling your subscription
                  will stop recurring fees going forward, but will not retroactively refund current payments, and you will retain access
                  to your paid-for Solutions until the end of the then-current Subscription Term. If you do not cancel the subscription,
                  AVG will charge your credit card or debit card within a reasonable time prior to the end of the then-current
                  Subscription Term for the then-current extension fee (which may be higher than the price you initially paid) and, on
                  receipt of payment, will extend the Subscription Term for the applicable Extension Term.
               </li>
               <li>
                  3.2. <span class="style1">Refunds</span>.
                  <ul class="nostyle">
                     <li>3.2.1. <span class="style1">For Mobile Solutions</span>. The quickest way to obtain a refund on a Mobile Solution is to follow the
                        process established by the Mobile App Store from which you purchased the Solution. If the Mobile App Store does
                        not honor your refund request, but you are otherwise within 30 days of your initial purchase, you may be able to
                        return your Mobile Solution for a refund of all amounts paid (other than for in-app purchases or subscriptions) by
                        following the instructions at <a href="http://www.avg.com/billing" target="_blank">http://www.avg.com/billing</a>.
                     </li>
                     <li>3.2.2. <span class="style1">Other Solutions</span>. Certain other Solutions may be eligible for return and refund. Please see

                     </li>
                     <li>3.3. <span class="style1">Payment Information</span>. In an effort to ensure your use of a Solution is not interrupted, AVG may participate
                        in recurring billing programs or account updated services. If your Subscription Term automatically extends and
                        AVG is unable to charge the credit card or debit card AVG has on file for you, AVG at its option may obtain an updated card number, expiration date or other updated payment information from your bank or another source, or
                        your card issuer may automatically charge your card without notifying AVG or you. If you wish to use PayPal to
                        purchase a subscription, you must open an account with PayPal and abide by the terms of service of PayPal, which

                     <li>4.1.1. <span class="style1">Purchase of Solutions Through a Mobile App Store</span>. Each Mobile App Store posts the terms on which it sells Solutions to you, including the terms on which the Mobile App Store may (or may not) accept returns or grant refunds of the purchase price you pay.

Your sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the warranty in this Section 7.1 is replacement of the defective media or Solution or, at AVG’s option, return of the Solution for a full refund.

            <h3>11. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>11.1. <span class="style1">Application</span>. This Binding Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver applies to any Dispute arising
                  from or related to a Solution or this Agreement and involving you and AVG and/or its Group Companies.
                  “<span class="style1 style2">Dispute</span>,” for purposes of this Section 11, means any dispute, action, or other controversy regardless of the
                  particular cause of action(s) asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or legal basis,
                  claims for breach of contract, fraud, and violation of statute or regulation).
               </li>
               <li>11.2. <span class="style1">Notice</span>. In the event of a Dispute, you must provide AVG with a notice of Dispute, which is a written
                  statement of the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and
                  the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by email to AVG at <a href="mailto:legalnotice@avg.com">legalnotice@avg.com</a> (stating
                  Subject: Section 11.2 Notice of Dispute Under EULA).
               </li>
               <li>11.3. <span class="style1">CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span>. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</li>
               <li>11.4. <span class="style1">Agreement to Arbitrate</span>. If you and AVG do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“<span class="style1 style2">FAA</span>”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq, except as provided in Sections 10.5 and 10.8.2, below. Except as provided in Sections 10.5 and 10.8.2, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</li>

                  11.5. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
                  <ul class="nostyle">
                     <li>11.5.1. <span class="style1">Small Claims Court</span>. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.</li>
                     <li>11.5.2. <span class="style1">Intellectual Property</span>. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or AVG's intellectual property, including any Disputes concerning Section 6 of this Agreement, will be resolved in court.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  11.6. <span class="style1">Arbitration Procedures</span>. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “<span class="style1 style2">AAA</span>”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “<span class="style1 style2">Consumer Procedures</span>”).
                  <ul class="nostyle">
                     <li>11.6.1. <span class="style1">Arbitration Costs</span>. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (AVG). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, AVG will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. AVG does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</li>
                     <li>11.6.2. <span class="style1">Laws And Rules Governing Arbitration</span>. Except as provided in Section 10.8, the AAA's Consumer
                        Procedures shall be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule
                        R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final
                        decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. In ruling on a Dispute,
                        the neutral arbitrator will apply the terms of this Agreement and the laws of the State of Delaware. You will
                        commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration
                        proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA
                        Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) shall have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon
                        the request of a party.
                     </li>
                     <li>11.6.3. <span class="style1">AAA Not Integral To Agreement To Arbitrate</span>. You and AVG agree that the use of the AAA to
                        administer arbitration is not integral to the parties' agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot
                        conduct an arbitration, you and AVG shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who shall resolve the

               <li>11.7. <span class="style1">Severability</span>. If one or more parts of Section 11 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or
                  some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be
                  resolved subject to all remaining parts of Section 11 and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance
                  results in all of some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court
                  proceeding shall be the state or federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware. For purposes of any such court
                  proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the Delaware courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you
                  further waive objection based upon improper venue or <span class="style2">forum non conveniens</span> and will not seek transfer to another

                        otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial

               <li>13.1. <span class="style1">AVG Security and Safeguard Toolbars</span>. This Section 13.1 applies to Solutions known as the AVG Security Toolbar, AVG Safeguard Toolbar or any other AVG-supplied Internet browser, browser tool or add-on (each, a “<span class="style1 style2">Toolbar</span>”). BY PROCEEDING TO INSTALL THE TOOLBAR, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, UPON ITS INSTALLATION, THE TOOLBAR WILL MODIFY VIA THE SETTINGS OF YOUR BROWSER HOME PAGE, THE “DNS ERROR PAGE” AND “ERROR 404 PAGE,” AND OTHER FEATURES OF YOUR DEVICE. FURTHERMORE, ONCE INSTALLED, THE TOOLBAR MAY COMMUNICATE CERTAIN BASIC USAGE INFORMATION TO AVG, ITS SUPPLIERS AND RESELLERS (for example concerning the number of installations and unique users, IP addresses, search queries, the number of clicks which the Toolbar receives, the number of searches performed by users, etc.).

                  <ul class="nostyle">
                     <li>13.2.1. AVG may include the AVG Do Not Track feature (“<span class="style1 style2">DNT</span>”) within certain of the Solutions. DNT allows you to identify certain websites that are tracking your online activities, and gives you the option to request that websites block such tracking activities (or not) according to your privacy preferences. DNT may inform any tracking websites or website elements about your wish to block their activities and such websites or website elements may not abide by your wishes.</li>
                     <li>13.2.2. By default, the applicable Solutions are delivered with DNT activated, which may prevent you from viewing some content of some Web sites. You may change your preferences at any time by clicking the DNT icon on your Internet browser.</li>
                     <li>13.2.3. Without limiting the provisions of Section 7, AVG DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT DNT WILL IDENTIFY OR BLOCK ANY OR ALL TRACKING BY WEBSITES. SOME TRACKING MAY OCCUR EVEN WITH DNT ENABLED.</li>

                     a Personal Support service to your reasonable satisfaction, AVG, as its sole obligation and your sole and exclusive
                     remedy, will refund the fee you paid for the applicable Personal Support service. The fees you pay for Personal
                     Support are otherwise nonrefundable. Without limiting Section 7.3, AVG DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT ANY PERSONAL SUPPORT SERVICE WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUES FOR WHICH YOU PURCHASED THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE BE SATISFACTORY TO YOU.

                           expires at the end of the Redemption Period unless you make an additional purchase.

                                 Personal Support before, because AVG reserves the right to change the services and features at any time by posting
                                 a revised description at www.avg.com. If AVG, in the course of providing Personal Support, determines that your
                                 issue is beyond the scope of Personal Support, it will make commercially reasonable efforts to describe the nature of
                                 the issue so you can seek appropriate assistance.

                                 Personal Support by requesting services (1) beyond those reasonably expected from someone using a subscriptionbased
                                 plan in accordance with the Applicable Conditions, (2) for any Device not specified by the Applicable

                        <li>(a) <span class="style1">Preparation</span>. Before you request Personal Support, you must (i) confirm that you have

                           Device settings, and otherwise configure the Devices and network to receive and implement Personal Support, (ii)
                           download or copy the applicable Software to your Device, (iii) confirm that the applicable Devices are connected to

                           You must also create a complete back-up of all data on the Device, because AVG DISCLAIMS ANY
                           ALL LIABILITY FOR AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE LOSS, CORRUPTION OR
                           RECOVERY OF DATA, PROGRAMS, USER SETTINGS AND OTHER MATERIALS AND FUNCTIONALITY

                        <li>(b) <span class="style1">Support Tool</span>. At AVG’s request, you will authorize AVG to download and install on
                           your Devices a software program (the “<strong>Support Tool</strong>”) that enables the AVG to access and control your Device
                           remotely. The Support Tool comprises Software for the purposes of this Agreement, the Subscription Period for
                           which expires at the end of the then-current Personal Support session. AVG will use the Support Tool to analyze,
                           diagnose, resolve more difficult problems and/or perform system optimization functions, and will make
                           commercially reasonable efforts to remove the Support Tool from your Devices at the end of the session.
